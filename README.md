# Daily Drive Music

Self hosted Spotify "Daily Drive" playlist creation and synchronization without the podcasts.

#### What is the "Daily Drive" playlist?
According to Spotify news article:
> Itâ€™s a new Spotify playlist that combines the very best of news talk shows, including the relevancy and personality of the hosts, with the best of audio streaming (on demand, personalized playing and discovery). It combines music you love with relevant, timely world updates from reputable sources â€“ all put together in a seamless and unified listening experience. - [*Your Daily Drive: Music and News Thatâ€™ll Brighten Your Commute*](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-06-12/your-daily-drive-music-and-news-thatll-brighten-your-commute/)

#### Motivations:
I like a lot the idea of a playlist mixing different type of music I'm listening to. Spotify already creates several daily mixes but each of them is focused on a specific type of music (pop, rock, etc..). "Daily Drive" is the first daily playlist mixing different music types and I found it pretty relative to my music taste. The negative point is that the playlist is meant to look like a radio, music divided by news and talk shows, but I do only want the music.

#### What is this repository doing?
This repository is a Go program meant to create a new playlist called "My Music Daily Drive" and sync it every day with the Spotify's "Daily Drive" playlist without the podcasts.

#### Result:
Spotify's "Daily Drive" playlist:
